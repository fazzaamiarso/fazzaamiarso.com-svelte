## Problem

The idea came from the struggle of me and my friends back at high school where we held online events.  
For break time, we want to open a song request submission from attendees. As we use Spotify, there were no integrated platform that can collect song requests easily.

I also draw inspiration from [ngl.link](https://ngl.link) and Theo Browne's [OnAVote](https://github.com/TheoBr/OnAVote/tree/259026b5405b3895914bc739bcfb2ed36d262f68).
